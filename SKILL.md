# DeePMD-kit Offline Installer (local build)

Build a self-contained `.sh` offline installer for DeePMD-kit using conda
`constructor`. The recipe is **bundled in `assets/`**, so the build is
self-contained — no external repo checkout is required.

## Quick Start

Do NOT write build commands by hand. Call the bundled scripts with parameters.

**Mode A — package a RELEASED version (CPU or GPU):**

```bash
# CPU  (installers land in dist/<variant>/, named deepmd-kit-<ver>-<date>-<hash>-<variant>-...sh)
bash scripts/build.sh --version 3.2.0b0
bash scripts/verify_offline.sh dist/cpu/*.sh 3.2.0b0

# GPU (CUDA 12.9 matches upstream). Build on any node; VERIFY on a GPU node.
bash scripts/build.sh --version 3.2.0b0 --cuda 12.9
bash scripts/verify_offline.sh dist/cuda129/*.sh 3.2.0b0
```

**Mode B — package a GIT COMMIT of deepmd-kit (two stages):**

```bash
# Stage 1: build the commit from source into a local conda channel (Docker; heavy,
# tens of min–>1h). Emits ./local-channel/COMMIT_BUILD.env (exact version+build+python).
bash scripts/build_pkg_from_commit.sh --commit <sha>                       # CPU (config auto-picked)
# GPU: pass a .ci_support config (run once with no --config to list them):
bash scripts/build_pkg_from_commit.sh --commit <sha> --cuda 12.9 \
     --config linux_64_cuda_compiler_version12.9mpimpichpython3.11.____cpython

# Stage 2: bundle that exact commit build into the offline installer.
bash scripts/build.sh --from-commit-channel ./local-channel
bash scripts/verify_offline.sh dist/*/*.sh
```

> Stage 1 (building a commit from source) must be validated on Linux against the
> live conda-forge feedstock — see [references/notes.md](references/notes.md).

The verify step NO LONGER stops at `dp -h` — it runs `dp train` + `dp freeze` +
`lammps` inference in a clean, network-isolated environment. That is the real bar.

**Backend + version parameterization (mentor requirement):**

```bash
# Default (TF + JAX); specify backend and pin versions:
bash scripts/build.sh --version 3.2.0b0 --backend pytorch --torch-version ">=2.5"
bash scripts/build.sh --version 3.2.0b0 --cuda 12.9 --glibc 2.28 --torch-version ">=2.5"
```

A build is only "done" when the **verify step passes**, not when a `.sh` appears.

## Why three modes

`constructor` can only bundle conda packages that ALREADY exist on a channel.
- **Mode A (releases)** pulls the pre-built conda package by version — cpu + the
  single cudaXXX build conda-forge publishes per release (cuda129 for 3.2.0b0).
- **Mode B (commit)**: no per-commit deepmd-kit conda package exists anywhere, so
  the commit must FIRST be built from source into a local channel (Stage 1), then
  constructor consumes it (Stage 2). Releases (Mode A) skip Stage 1.
- **Mode C (cuda126 / cuda128)**: conda-forge does NOT publish these CUDA builds,
  so constructor cannot make them at all. `scripts/build_modec.sh` instead pip-installs
  torch cuXXX + deepmd + CPU-only TensorFlow + a lammps wheel, then `conda-pack`s the
  env into a self-extracting .sh. (cuda131 = the cuda128 build relabeled for CUDA 13.1
  machines; deepmd 3.2.0b0 has no native CUDA-13 build.)

## Agent responsibilities (orchestration only)

1. Confirm conda is available (`conda --version`). `build.sh` installs
   `constructor` / `conda-libmamba-solver` itself if missing.
2. Decide the mode: released **version** → Mode A; a deepmd-kit **commit** → Mode B.
3. Collect CPU-vs-CUDA (`--cuda <ver>`, recommend `12.9` for GPU) and target
   hardware (`--glibc <ver>` for the target system's GLIBC).
4. Collect **backend selection** (`--backend all|tensorflow|pytorch|jax`) and
   version pins (`--torch-version`, `TF_VERSION`/`LAMMPS_VERSION` envs).
5. Run the bundled scripts with those parameters. Never run raw `constructor`
   or `conda build` commands — the scripts freeze the error-prone steps.
6. Run `scripts/verify_offline.sh` (Mode C installers use `scripts/verify_offline_modec.sh`). The bar is: installs offline → `dp train`
   on a minimal system → `dp freeze` → `lammps` inference with the frozen model.
   GPU mode auto-detected from filename; MUST run on a node with GPU+driver.

## Key parameters

| Flag / env                | Meaning                                       | Default     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `--version`               | deepmd-kit version (Mode A)                    | `assets/version.txt` (now 3.2.0b0) |
| `--cuda`                  | CUDA version; omit = CPU                       | "" (CPU)    |
| `--glibc`                 | target system GLIBC version                    | 2.28 (GPU builds) |
| `--backend`               | ML backends: all / tensorflow / pytorch / jax  | all         |
| `--torch-version`         | pin PyTorch version (enables pytorch in bundle) | —           |
| `--example <name>`        | bundle a deepmd example (dpa4, se_e2_a) for offline verify | — |
| `--from-commit-channel`   | local channel from Stage 1 (Mode B)            | —           |
| `--split <N>`             | split GPU `.sh` into N parts (GitHub 2GiB cap) | off         |
| `--recipe-dir`            | recipe dir with construct.yaml                 | bundled `assets/` |
| `--output-dir`            | where the installer is written                 | `./dist/<variant>/` |
| `--commit` (Stage 1)      | deepmd-kit git commit to build                 | —           |
| `TF_VERSION`/`LAMMPS_VERSION` env | pin TensorFlow / LAMMPS                 | `>=2.19` / unpinned |

## Agent checklist

- [ ] conda available
- [ ] Mode A: `build.sh --version` (+ `--cuda` if GPU) — OR — Mode B: `build_pkg_from_commit.sh --commit` then `build.sh --from-commit-channel` — OR — Mode C: `build_modec.sh cu126|cu128` (CUDA builds conda-forge doesn't publish)
- [ ] `.sh` installer produced; manifest reports absolute path + sha256
- [ ] `verify_offline.sh` PASSED — the real bar: **dp train → dp freeze → lammps inference** in clean offline env; GPU mode also checks `nvidia-smi` + backend GPU + XLA/libdevice proof
- [ ] reported version / commit / backend versions match what was requested

## Notes & troubleshooting

- Targets, requirements, the manual `constructor` workflow (for debugging only),
  reproducibility/pinning, the freeze→pin loop, GPU specifics, and the full
  commit-based (two-stage) flow are documented in
  [references/notes.md](references/notes.md).
- GPU builds export `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA` / `CONDA_OVERRIDE_GLIBC` and use the
  libmamba solver so a GPU-less build node can still resolve the CUDA variant;
  the resulting `.sh` is multi-GB (use `--split` for GitHub's 2GiB asset cap).
- For stable releases, do not build off the `deepmd-kit_rc` channel label — see
  the warning at the top of `assets/construct.yaml`.
- The live CI is `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` (daily; builds ALL variants — cpu/cuda129 via Mode A, cuda126/cuda128 via Mode C — runs a no-GPU smoke test, uploads to the per-version Release, and commits `assets/manifest.json` directly). There is no separate GPU verify lane: per the mentor, deepmd's own PR tests cover the code, so we verify the packaging once and trust it thereafter.
